# HDB Resale Price Prediction
Dataset used to predict resale prices of flats is found [here](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view), provided by HDB. This task originally appeared as an assignment for ST1131 and is done by finding a suitable linear model via trial-and-error in R. This repository explores using tree-based models in Python on the same dataset to see if it can provide an improvement over linear modelling and avoiding trial-and-error process.
